## Project
[A-Z Handwritten Alphabets in .csv format](https://www.kaggle.com/sachinpatel21/az-handwritten-alphabets-in-csv-format)

#### Content
The dataset contains 26 folders (A-Z) containing handwritten images in size 28x28 pixels, each alphabet in the image is centre fitted to 20x20 pixel box.

Each image is stored as Gray-level

#### Acknowledgements
The images are taken from NIST(https://www.nist.gov/srd/nist-special-database-19) and NMIST large dataset and few other sources which were then formatted as mentioned above.
